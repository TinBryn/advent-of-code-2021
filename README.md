# Advent of Code 2021

## 🎄 Merry Christmas fellow Rustacean 🎄

It's that time of year again, Santa 🎅 is in trouble and the elves needs our help to save Christmas. For such an
important task we need the utmost in reliability and performance so I will be using Rust to do my
part. So get ready to `.unwrap()` those 🎁 to save Christmas and don't `panic!()`.

## Structure

This is setup as a Cargo workspace with one crate for each day's problem, plus any additional
common requirements that arise (such as 2019's intcode computer). Each crate will be a binary and
can be executed simply via `cargo run`
