# Advent of Code 2021

## Merry Christmas fellow Rustaceans

It's that time of year again, Santa is in trouble and needs our help to save Christmas. For such an
important task we need the utmost in reliability and performance so I will be using Rust to do my
part.

## Structure

This is setup as a Cargo workspace with one crate for each day's problem, plus any additional
common requirements that arise (such as 2019's intcode computer). Each crate will be a binary and
can be executed simply via `cargo run`
